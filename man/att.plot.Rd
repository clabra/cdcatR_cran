\title{Plots for attribute mastery estimates}
\usage{
att.plot(cdcat.obj, i, k = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdcat.obj}{An object of class \code{cdcat}}

\item{i}{Scalar numeric. It specifies the examinee to be plotted}

\item{k}{Numeric vector. It specifies the attribute/s to be plotted. Default is \code{NULL}, which plots all attributes}
}
\value{
\code{att.plot} returns a plot of class \code{ggplot}.
}
\description{
This function generates a plot monitoring the attribute mastery estimates (\emph{x-axis}: Item position, \emph{y-axis}: Mastery posterior probability estimate).
If a parametric CD-CAT has been conducted, posterior probabilites (with confident intervals) of mastering each attribute are plotted.
If a nonparametric CD-CAT has been conducted (and pseudo-probabilites have been computed), both nonparametric classification and pseudo-posterior probabilites (with confident intervals) of mastering each attribute are plotted. Pseudo-posterior probabilities is a method in progress. Caution in the interpretation is advised.
Colors are used in the plots to indicate mastery (green), non-mastery (red), or uncertainty (blue).
